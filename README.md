### Details to Include in the Software Request Form

When filling out the software request form for installation on an ASU RC HPC supercomputer, including detailed and specific information can significantly enhance the efficiency of the process. Here are the key details you should include in your request:

1. **Software Name and Version:** Clearly specify the name of the software and the version you require. If the version is not specified, the latest stable version might be assumed.

2. **Justification for Request:** Explain why this software is necessary for your research or projects. Include details about the projects that will utilize it, which can help in prioritizing the request.

3. **Dependency Information:** List any dependencies the software has, including specific versions of other software or libraries it needs to function correctly. This helps ensure all necessary components are installed together.

4. **License Information:** If the software requires a license, specify whether you already have a license or if assistance is needed in acquiring one. Include license type if applicable (individual, group, site license).

5. **Links to software being requested:** Having a link to the software will help with making sure we are installing the correct software for your request.

6. **Contact Information:** Provide your contact details for any follow-up questions or clarifications needed regarding your request. This includes your name, department, and the best way to reach you (email, phone).

7. **Additional Instructions or Requirements:** If there are specific configurations or customizations needed, describe them clearly. This includes any environment modules that need to be loaded or specific paths for installation.

Providing comprehensive and precise information in your request not only speeds up the review process but also minimizes back-and-forth communication, leading to a smoother and faster installation.
